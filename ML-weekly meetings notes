March 22, 2024:
- We discussed on how we can use convolutional neural networks to deal with audio classification
- We can use mel spectogram to change the sound wave into an image and then we can use CNNs to do the classification

Next week goals:
1. read the paper on transformers that sohiel gave to us
2. look into the huggin face dataset, explore it adn get to do fun with it
